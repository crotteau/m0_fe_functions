# Self-Evaluation

- Reflect on your learning and work today. What are you most proud of?
I just spent SO LONG on the final stock/invetory question in the functions.js file. I'm proud that I figured it out eventually after going in circles for what seems like hours.
- In your own words, why are functions a powerful tool in our applications?
Functions are important in applications because they hold instructions for carrying out various processes. They work by processing a series of inputs to give you an output (return value). They are what give applications utility and make then dynamic and interactive.
